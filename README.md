Project Overview
This project explores crime trends in the United States using real-world crime rate data. We analyze different crime types, identify peak years, detect long-term trends, and use machine learning to predict future crime rates.

🚀 Key Insights
✔ Property Crimes (Larceny Theft & Burglary) had the highest crime rates.
✔ Crime rates peaked in the early 2000s, then showed a declining trend.
✔ Robbery Rate peaked in 2006, while Violent Crime Rate peaked in 2000.
✔ The 5-year rolling average confirmed a consistent decline in violent crimes.
✔ Predictive modeling suggests a further decrease in crime rates over the coming years.

📊 Techniques Used
🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, formatting)
🔹 Time Series Analysis (Crime trends over the years)
🔹 Peak Crime Year Detection (Using .idxmax() to find peak values)
🔹 Rolling Averages for Trend Analysis (Smoothing out fluctuations)
🔹 Outlier Detection (Identifying anomalies in crime data)
🔹 Crime Prediction with Linear Regression (Forecasting future crime rates)
🔹 Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn (Line plots, bar charts, heatmaps)

📁 Dataset Used

⚡ Future Improvements
✔ Adding more socio-economic factors (e.g., unemployment, population growth).
✔ Geospatial analysis (Mapping crime density per state or region).
✔ Exploring the impact of policies & law enforcement efforts on crime rates.
